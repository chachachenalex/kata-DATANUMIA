# Yatzy Refactoring Kata
This my java kata required by datanumia. It is a maven project.
I have refactoried the codes by implementing new features of java 8 (for ex: stream and etc.)
During the work, I tried to apply TDD by rewriting firstly the part of test then coding the main part until all the test cases turn to green.

## Kata Description

The problem that this code is designed to solve is explained here: [Yatzy](https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/yatzy.html)
